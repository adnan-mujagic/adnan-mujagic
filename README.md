### Hello, fellow programmer!

My name is Adnan Mujagic, and I am a 3rd year student of Information Technologies at International Burch University. I am always fascinated by the way information systems can simplify our life, and allow us do things a lot more efficiently. I am currently focused on frontend development on the web, but I am trying to master the backend skills/frameworks as well. I am constantly trying to improve and learn something new and exciting. In case you find any of my public repositories useful, insightful, or just want to show support, please consider staring them! :) I hope that some day I can write comprehensive, meaningful, elegant code that can solve real problems.

Here are some programming languages and frameworks that I've had experience with:
- Python
- Node
- JavaScript
- Java
- C - very little though
- React
- React Native
- MSSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

I am currently trying to learn about:
- Spring
- C#
